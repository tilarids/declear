This is WIP project to automatically "OCR" Ukrainian income and property declarations. Any mid-to-high-level government official in Ukraine is required to file such a declaration so having them in a searchable and accessible form is very important. It simplifies the analysis of the government sector and helps fighting corruption. The problem is that old declarations were filed in paper form and even when they were digitized they were rarely translated into machine-readable form. Most of those declarations are only accessible as PDF scans with handwritten data in there.

[declarations.com.ua](http://declarations.com.ua) is a crowd-sourced attempt to "OCR" those scans into machine-readable form. They provide processed declarations as an open dataset. *declear* is an independent effort that uses this dataset and provides models to OCR those PDFs automatically.
